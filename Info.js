            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm Alessandro, 24 years old and graduated from the joint master Entrepreneurship at the University of Amsterdam and the Vrije Universiteit. Before I obtained my master's degree, I completed the Bachelor's degree in International Business Administration at the University of Amsterdam, where I also followed a minor in programming. After my studies I had a great opportunity to travel through Asia for eight months and discover new cultures. Currently I am working hard to develop my skills in front-end development.</p>
            
            <h3>Interest</h3>
            <p>Because of my passion and curiosity about entrepreneurship, I founded a general partnership with my two brothers. By combining this passion with our shared interest in Bitcoin
our first project was setting up a webshop that sold physical bitcoin coins, not to be confused with the real digital Bitcoin coin.</p>
